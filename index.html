                <p>As a popular open source development project,
                    Python has an active supporting community of contributors
                    and users that also make their software available for 
                    other Python developers to use under open source license terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    pip is the preferred installer program. 
                    Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default 
                    with the Python binary installers.

                <p>A Python program is read by a parser. Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, 
                    generated by the lexical analyzer. This chapter describes how the lexical analyzer 
                    breaks a file into tokens.</p>
                <p>
                    Python reads program text as Unicode code points;
                    the encoding of a source file can be given by an encoding declaration
                    and defaults to UTF-8, see PEP 3120 for details. 
                    If the source file cannot be decoded, a SyntaxError is raised.

                <p>
                    Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. 
                    All data in a Python program is represented by objects or 
                    by relations between objects. (In a sense, and in conformance 
                    to Von Neumann’s model of a “stored program computer”, 
                    code is also represented by objects.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every object has an identity, a type and a value. 
                    An object’s identity never changes once it has been created; 
                    you may think of it as the object’s address in memory. 
                    The ‘is’ operator compares the identity of two objects; 
                    the id() function returns an integer representing its identity.

                <p>
                    In programming, data type is an important concept.
                    Variables can store data of different types, 
                    and different types can do different things.
                    Python has the following data types built-in by default, 
                    in these categories:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    Text Type: str
                    Numeric Types: int, float, complex
                    Sequence Types: list, tuple, range
                    Mapping Type: dict
                    Set Types: set, frozenset
                    Boolean Type: bool
                    Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview
                </pre>

                        <p><b>Quotes</b></p>
                        <p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
                        <code>

                        <p>Boolean values, True or False, can be either obtained or used to provide additional
                            functionalities. Example: 
                        </p>
                        <code>  
                            a = 200
                            b = 33

                            if b > a:
                            print("b is greater than a")
                            else:
                            print("b is not greater than a")</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Quotes</b></p>
                        <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
                        <code>
                            a == b # Equals

                            a < b # Less than
                            a <= b # Less than or equal to
                            a > b # Greater than
                            a >= b # Greater than or equal to

            <article>
                <p>Compound statements contain (groups of) other statements; 
                    they affect or control the execution of those other statements in some way. 
                    In general, compound statements span multiple lines, 
                    although in simple incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The if, while and for statements implement traditional control flow constructs. 
                    try specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements, 
                    while the with statement allows the execution of initialization and finalization 
                    code around a block of code. 
                    Function and class definitions are also syntactically compound statements.
